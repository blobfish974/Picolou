## 📖 Introduction

This mobile App was developped using Expo (so React Native + Javascript).

It used an online API on Heroku to access the datas.
Link to heroku app: [paris-bar-api](https://paris-bar-api.herokuapp.com/).

## 🏗 Installation (for develeopping)

To try the app just run
```sh
❯ npm install
```
and then
```sh
❯ npm start
```

You'll need the  expo app on your smartphone (you can also use an emulator on your laptop)
You'll then need to scan a QR code to try the application



## ⚙️ Functionnalities 

Actually:
- display a (very small) list of bars
- give details on a specific bar



### Features to add

- favorites
- general improvments on the app
- map with all the bar -> maybe difficult
